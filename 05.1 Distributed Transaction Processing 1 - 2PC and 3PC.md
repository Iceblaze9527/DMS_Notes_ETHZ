# 05.1 Distributed Transaction Processing 1: 2PC and 3PC
[TOC]

## 1. Two Phase Commit (2PC)
### 1.1 2PC Protocol
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1kE2i3Os.png =600x)

1. Initially, the coordinator writes a `begin_commit` record in its log, sends a `VOTE-REQ` message to all participant sites, and enters the `WAIT` state.
2. When a participant receives a `VOTE-REQ` message, it checks if it could commit the transaction. If so, the participant writes a `ready` record in the log, sends a `YES` message to the coordinator, and enters `READY` state; otherwise, the participant writes an `abort` record and sends a `NO` message to the coordinator.
3. If the decision of the site is to abort, it can forget about that transaction, since an abort decision serves as a veto (i.e., unilateral abort).
4. After the coordinator has received a reply from every participant, it decides whether to commit or to abort the transaction. If even one participant has registered a negative vote, the coordinator has to abort the transaction globally. So it writes an `abort` record, sends a `ABORT` message to all participant sites, and enters the `ABORT` state; otherwise, it writes a `commit` record, sends a `COMMIT` message to all participants, and enters the `COMMIT` state.
5. The participants either commit or abort the transaction according to the coordinator’s instructions and send back an acknowledgment, at which point the coordinator terminates the transaction by writing an `end_of_transaction` record in the log

### 1.2 2PC Correctness
- **AC1:** All processors that reach a decision reach the same one (agreement, consensus).
- **AC2:** A processor cannot reverse its decision.
- **AC3:** Commit can only be decided if all processors vote YES (no imposed decisions).
- **AC4:** If there are no failures and all processors voted YES, the decision will be to commit (non triviality).
- **AC5:** Consider an execution with normal failures. If all failures are repaired and no more failures occur for sufficiently long, then all processors will eventually reach a decision (liveness).

### 1.3 Failure: Termination and Recovery
#### Termination and Blockage
If a failure occurs, how can the remaining operational sites deal with it.

- **Non-blocking:** the occurrence of failures should not force the sites to wait until the failure is repaired to terminate the transaction.
- **Blocking of 2PC:** 2PC may block if the coordinator fails after having sent a VOTE-REQ to all processes and all processes vote YES. (NOTE: **the coordinator has no uncertainty period**. To block the coordinator must fail).
    - A process sent a YES-vote message to the coordinator process and, due to communication failure, was no longer able to communicate with other processes immediately after that.
    - The coordinator process fails immediately after receiving YES-vote messages from all participants.

#### Recovery and Independence
When a failure occurs, how do the sites where the failure occurred deal with it.

- **Independent:** a failed site can determine the outcome of a transaction without having to obtain remote information.
- **No Independent Recovery of 2PC:** It is not possible to design independent recovery protocols (and, therefore, nonblocking termination protocols) when multiple sites fail.

#### Recovery by Persistence
**Persistence** is achieved by writing a distributive transaction log record (DT log). This requires flushing the log buffer to disk (I/O). This is done for every state change in the protocol and every distributed transaction. 

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ6ep23_i.png =800x)

- When sending `VOTE-REQ`, the coordinator writes a `START-2PC` log record (to know the coordinator).
- If a participant votes `YES`, it writes a `YES` record in the log **BEFORE** it send its vote. If it votes `NO`, then it writes a `NO` record.
- If the coordinator decides to commit or abort, it writes a `COMMIT` or `ABORT` record **BEFORE** sending any message.
- After receiving the coordinator’s decision, a participant writes its own decision in the log.

### 1.4 Termination Protocols
A **timeout** occurs at a destination site when it cannot get an expected message from a source site within the expected time period. In this section, we consider that this is due to the failure of the source site.

#### Coordinator Timeout
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJGFyh3Oj.png =250x)

1. **Timeout in the `WAIT` state.** In the `WAIT` state, the coordinator is waiting for the local decisions of the participants. The coordinator cannot unilaterally commit the transaction since the global-commit rule has not been satisfied. However, it can decide to globally abort the transaction, in which case ==it writes an abort record in the log and sends a `ABORT` message to all the participants.==
2. **Timeout in the `COMMIT` or `ABORT` states.** In this case the coordinator is not certain that the commit or abort procedures have been completed by the local recovery managers at all of the participant sites. Thus ==the coordinator repeatedly sends the `COMMIT` or `ABORT` commands to the sites that have not yet responded, and waits for their acknowledgement.==

#### Participant Timeout
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1URxnnOi.png =350x)

1. **Timeout in the `INITIAL` state.** In this state the participant is waiting for a `VOTE-REQ` message. The coordinator must have failed in the `INITIAL` state. ==The participant can unilaterally abort the transaction following a timeout.==
2. **Timeout in the `READY` state.** In this state the participant has voted to commit the transaction but does not know the global decision of the coordinator. The participant cannot unilaterally reach a decision. Since it is in the `READY` state, it must have voted to commit the transaction. Therefore, it cannot now change its vote and unilaterally abort it. On the other hand, it cannot unilaterally decide to commit it, since it is possible that another participant may have voted to abort it. ==In this case, the participant will remain blocked until it can learn from someone (either the coordinator or some other participant) the ultimate fate of the transaction.==

#### [Cooperative Termination Protocol (CTP)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep545/01wi/lectures/class7/tsld027.htm)
Assume coordinator includes a list of participants in Request-to-Prepare.

If a participant times-out waiting for the decision, it runs the following protocol.

1. Participant P sends Decision-Req to other participants
2. If participant Q voted No or hasn't voted or received Abort from the coordinator, it responds Abort
3. If participant Q received Commit from the coordinator, it responds Commit.
4. If participant Q is uncertain, it responds Uncertain (or doesn't respond at all).

If all participants are uncertain, then P remains blocked.

### 1.5 Recovery Protocols
In this section, we take the opposite viewpoint: we are interested in investigating protocols that a coordinator or participant can use to **recover** their states when their sites fail and then restart.

#### DT Log Recovery
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e9phh_i.png =800x)

#### Coordinator Failure
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJGFyh3Oj.png =250x)

1. The coordinator fails while in the `INITIAL` state. This is before the coordinator has initiated the commit procedure. Therefore, it will ==start the commit process upon recovery.==
2. The coordinator fails while in the `WAIT` state. In this case, the coordinator has sent the “prepare” command. Upon recovery, the coordinator will ==restart the commit process for this transaction from the beginning by sending the “prepare” message one more time.==
3. The coordinator fails while in the `COMMIT` or `ABORT` states. In this case, the coordinator will have informed the participants of its decision and terminated the transaction. Thus, upon recovery, it ==does not need to do anything if all the acknowledgments have been received. Otherwise, the termination protocol is involved.==

#### Participant Failure
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1URxnnOi.png =350x)

1. A participant fails in the `INITIAL` state. Upon recovery, the participant should ==abort the transaction unilaterally==. Let us see why this is acceptable. Note that the coordinator will be in the `INITIAL` or `WAIT` state with respect to this transaction. If it is in the `INITIAL` state, it will send a “prepare” message and then move to the `WAIT` state. Because of the participant site’s failure, it will not receive the participant’s decision and will time out in that state. We have already discussed how the coordinator would handle timeouts in the `WAIT` state by globally aborting the transaction.
2. A participant fails while in the `READY` state. In this case the coordinator has been informed of the failed site’s affirmative decision about the transaction before the failure. Upon recovery, the participant at the failed site can ==treat this as a timeout in the `READY` state and hand the incomplete transaction over to its termination protocol.==
3. A participant fails while in the `ABORT` or `COMMIT` state. These states represent the termination conditions, so, upon recovery, the participant ==does not need to take any special action.==

#### Additional Cases for Non-atomic Logging and Message Sending
1. The coordinator fails after the `begin_commit` record is written in the log but before the `“prepare”` command is sent. The coordinator would react to this as a failure in the `WAIT` state (case 2 of the coordinator failures discussed above) and send the `“prepare”` command upon recovery.
2. A participant site fails after writing the `ready` record in the log but before sending the `“vote-commit”` message. The failed participant sees this as case 2 of the participant failures discussed before.
3. A participant site fails after writing the `abort` record in the log but before sending the `“vote-abort”` message. This is the only situation that is not covered by the fundamental cases discussed before. However, the participant does not need to do anything upon recovery in this case. The coordinator is in the `WAIT` state and will time out. The coordinator termination protocol for this state globally aborts the transaction.
4. The coordinator fails after logging its final decision record (`abort` or `commit`), but before sending its `“global-abort”` or `“global-commit”` message to the participants. The coordinator treats this as its case 3, while the participants treat it as a timeout in the `READY` state.
5. A participant fails after it logs an `abort` or a `commit` record but before it sends the acknowledgment message to the coordinator. The participant can treat this as its case 3. The coordinator will handle this by timeout in the `COMMIT` or `ABORT` state.

### 1.6 2PC Topology
#### Centralized 2PC

#### Linear 2PC
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ5GpcVOi.png =350x)![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byjm6c4uj.png =350x)

The total number of messages is 2n instead of 3n, but the number of rounds is 2n instead of 3

#### Distributed 2PC

## 2. Three Phase Commit (3PC)
Assume site failures only.

### 2.1 Non-blocking (NB) Rule
No operational process can decide to commit if there are operational processes that are uncertain. 

Thus, when running the cooperative termination protocol, if a process finds out that everybody else is uncertain, they can all safely decide to abort.

The consequence of the NB rule is that the coordinator cannot make a decision by itself as in 2PC. Before making a decision, it must be sure that everybody is out of the uncertainty area. Therefore, the coordinator, must first tell all processes what is going to happen: 
- request votes
- **prepare to commit**
- commit. 

This implies yet another round of messages!

### 2.2 3PC Protocol
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkqXNcp2j.png =600x)

### 2.3 Termination Protocols
#### Coordinator Timeout
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1Qv79pno.png =300x)

- `WAIT`: unilatorally abort
- `PRE-COMMIT`: ignore those who did not sent the ACK! (at this stage everybody has agreed to commit).

#### Participant Timeout
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy8nmq6ni.png =300x)

- `INITIAL`: abort
- `READY`: uncertain period, ask around
- `PRE-COMMIT`: not uncertain any more but needs to ask around!

#### Cooperative Termination Protocol
- Elect a new coordinator.
- New coordinator sends a “state req” to all processes. Participants send their state (aborted, committed, uncertain, committable).
- TR1 = If some “aborted” received, then abort.
- TR2 = If some “committed” received, then commit.
- TR3 = If all uncertain, then abort.
- TR4 = If some “committable” but no “committed” received, then send “PRE- COMMIT” to all, wait for ACKs and send commit message.

### 2.4 Recovery Procotols
#### Logs
- Coordinator writes “start-3PC” record before doing anything. It writes an “abort” or “commit” record before sending any abort or commit message.
- Participant writes its YES vote to the log before sending it to the coordinator. ==If it votes NO, it writes it to the log after sending it to the coordinator.== When reaching a decision, it writes it in the log (abort or commit).

#### Log Recovery
Processes in 3PC cannot independently recover unless they had already reached a decision or they have not participated at all:
- If the coordinator recovers and finds a “start 3PC” record in its log but no decision record, it needs to ask around to find out what the decision was. If it does not find a “start 3PC”, it will find no records of the transaction, then it can decide to abort.
- If a participant has a YES vote in its log but no decision record, it must ask around. If it has not voted, it can decide to abort.

### 2.5 Communication Failures: Network Partition
3PC does not deal with communication failures.

This can be avoided if quorums are used, that is, no decision can be made without having a quorum of processes who agree.

But blocking is still possible if no quorum can be formed.
