# 04.3 Transaction Processing 3: Recovery
[TOC]

## 0. Failures
### 0.1 Transaction Failure
#### Types
- transaction aborts
- rollbacks
- client fails in the middle of executing a transaction
- transaction times out

#### Solutions
- Typically done using undo logs or undo records
- Transactions must create an undo record every time they modify something
- The undo record is used to remove the changes made by the active transactions

### 0.2 System Failure
#### Types
- machine shuts down
- machine fails
- OS bails out

#### Solutions
- Typically done using redo and undo logs as well as by running a recovery procedure
- Undo the changes of active transactions at the time of failure, redo the changes of committed transactions
- Clean up the data in permanent storage

### 0.3 Media Failure
#### Types
- disk fails
- permanent storage has errors, etc.

#### Solutions
- replication
- separating data files from log files

## 1. Logging
### 1.1 Assumptions
- **physical logging:** the log entries contain the actual data modified by the transaction
- **persistency:** the log is kept in stable storage
- **serializable and strict execution:**
    - A transaction can be undone by restoring its before images
    - A transaction can be redone by applying its after images

:::info
**Is strict execution is required for correct recovery?**

Execution that is recoverable is the weakest requirement on execution that allows for correct recovery. However, strict execution may be preferred to simplify the recovery procedure 
- It avoids cascading aborts (ACA) so to undo writes of a transaction only before images from that transaction are necessary.
- Strict implies that committed writes will execute in the same order as their corresponding transactions commit, therefore the last committed value of an item will be written by the last committed transaction that wrote that item.
:::

### 1.2 Notions
- **LSN(Log Sequence Number):** LSN are used in the log to order transactions and decide what goes before or after. Also used to indicate log files.
- **SCN(System Change Number):**
    - SCN are used in snapshot isolation to identify correct snapshots
    - SCN are also attached to data to indicate the version of the data (which transaction modified the data last)
- **Transaction ID**
- **Before Image:** The value that existed in the database before a transaction modifies an item
- **After Image:** The value that exists in the database after a transaction modifies an item
- **UNDO:** UNDO the updates from uncommited transactions that might be in persistent storage
- **REDO:** REDO updates from commited transactions not persistent at commit time

### 1.3 Data Structures

## 2. Recovery Procedures
### 2.1 Introduction
#### Recovery Manager
The recovery manager implements the recovery procedure

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByFQr433i.png =600x)

#### Requirements for the Recovery Procedure
- Starts after System Failure
- Recover database state up to the changes made by all committed transactions as of the time of failure.
    - Changes made by all committed transactions
    - Use only state from permanent storage
- After recovery, no state for:
    - Active transactions while failure occurred
    - Past aborted transactions
- Buffer cache prior to failure
- Idempotent
    - Tolerate failures during recovery procedure

### 2.2 Buffer Cache Policies
#### STEAL
an uncommitted transaction is allowed to overwrite in persistent storage the changes of a committed transaction

This happens by pushing a dirty block to storage before the transaction commits

#### FORCE
all changes made by a transaction must be in persistent storage before the transaction commits

Requires to flush all blocks with updates form the transaction

#### Relationship to UNDO-REDO
- STEAL: UNDO required
- no-STEAL: -
- FORCE: -
- no-FORCE: REDO required

| | UNDO/REDO | UNDO/no-REDO | no-UNDO/REDO | no-UNDO/no-REDO |
|:---------------------:|:---------:|:------------:|:------------:|:---------------:|
| **STEAL/FORCE**       | 游릭        | 游릭           | 游댮           | 游댮              |
| **STEAL/no-FORCE**    | 游릭        | 游댮           | 游댮           | 游댮              |
| **no-STEAL/FORCE**    | 游릭        | 游릭           | 游릭           | 游릭              |
| **no-STEAL/no-FORCE** | 游릭        | 游댮           | 游릭           | 游댮              |

### 2.3 Characteristics
- **UNDO/REDO:** ignores the data stored on disk
- **UNDO/NO-REDO:** relies on the fact that all committed values are in persistent storage and, therefore, they have not been lost
- **NO-UNDO/REDO:** relies on the fact that we never write dirty blocks in the buffer cache. All data there is committed and is the last committed version

### 2.4 Transaction Operations
| | UNDO/REDO | UNDO/no-REDO | no-UNDO/REDO |
|---|---|---|---|
| **READ** | from buffer cache | from buffer cache | if first write: from buffer cache; else: from temp buffer |
| **WRITE** | (BI,AI) to persistent log; AI to buffer cache | BI to persistent log; AI to buffer cache | AI to persistent log; AI to temp buffer |
| **COMMIT** | to persistent log | FLUSH(buffer cache); to persistent log | APPLY(temp buffer); to persistent log |
| **ABORT** | restore BI | restore BI | discard temp buffer |
| **Forced I/O** | logs | data and logs | logs |

### 2.5 Recovery Algorithms
:::info
For the questions regarding execution, consider the database persistent state with 5 items (X1-X5) with the following values:

X1:10, X2:20, X3:8, X4:16, X5:32 

This is the database state at the beginning of the execution of the recovery procedure. (might not be correct!)

And persistent log where each entry contains Log Sequence Number, Transaction ID, Item ID, Before Image, and After Image

```
#LSN, TXid, item, BI, AI
1001, T1, X1, 2, 10
1002, T1, X2, 4, 20
1003, T2, X3, 8, 30
1004, T2, X3, 8, 33
1005, T1, X4, 16, 40
1006, T2, COMMIT
1007, T1, X3, 33, 36
1008, T3, X5, 32, 50
1009, T3, COMMIT
```

#### UNDO/REDO
```python!
COMMITED, UNDONE, REDONE = [], [], []

for entry in reversed(LOG):
    T, x = entry.transaction, entry.item
    BI, AI = entry.before_image, entry.after_image
    
    if x == "COMMIT":
        COMMITED.append(T)
        continue
    else:# T is ABORTED
        if not (x in UNDONE or x in REDONE):
            if T in COMMITED:
                apply_image(x,AI,DATA)
                REDONE.append(x)
            else:
                apply_image(x,BI,DATA)
                UNDONE.append(x)
    
    if set(UNDONE) | set(REDONE) == set(DATA.keys()):
        break # Procedure terminates when all items are in either the UNDONE or REDONE list

>>> COMMITED
[T3,T2]
>>> UNDONE
[X3,X4,X2,X1]
>>> REDONE
[X5]
>>> DATA
{X1:2, X2:4, X3:33, X4:16, X5:50}
```

#### UNDO/NO-REDO
```python!
COMITTED, UNDONE = [],[]

for entry in reversed(LOG):
    T, x = entry.transaction, entry.item
    BI = entry.before_image
    
    if x == "COMMIT":
        COMMITED.append(T)
        continue
    else:
        if (not x in UNDONE) and (not T in COMMITED):
            apply_image(x,BI,DATA)
            UNDONE.append(x)
    
    if set(UNDONE) == set(DATA.keys()):
        break

>>> COMMITED
[T3,T2]
>>> UNDONE
[X3,X4,X2,X1]
>>> DATA
{X1:2, X2:4, X3:33, X4:16, X5:32}
```

#### NO-UNDO/REDO
```python!
COMITTED, REDONE = [], []

for entry in reversed(LOG):
    T, x = entry.transaction, entry.item
    AI = entry.after_image

    if x == "COMMIT":
        COMMITED.append(T)
        continue
    else:
        if (not x in REDONE) and (T in COMMITED):
            apply_image(x,AI,DATA)
            REDONE.append(x)
    
    if set(REDONE) == set(DATA.keys()):
        break

>>> COMMITED
[T3,T2]
>>> REDONE
[X5,X3]
>>> DATA
{X1:10, X2:20, X3:33, X4:16, X5:50}
```

### 2.6 Alternative Ways
#### UNDO/REDO
```!
For every item in the database:
    Find the last committed transaction that modified the item and REDO the modification
    If no committed transaction modified the item, find the first aborted transaction than modified the item and UNDO the modification
    If no transaction has touched the item, its value is correct (we assume we start from a consistent state)
```

In practice, not done like this because there are many more items than log entries, easier to process the log sequentially from end to the beginning.

#### UNDO/no-REDO
```!
For every item in the database
    If no aborted transaction has touched it, then it is correct
    Otherwise, find the last aborted transaction that touched the item and UNDO it
```

It works because we are assuming strict execution:
- There can only be one aborted transaction that modified the correct value at the time of failure (cannot overwrite uncommitted items)
- It is enough to undo that transaction and we have the last committed value

#### no-UNDO/REDO
```!
For every item in the database
    Find the last committed transaction that touched it and REDO it
```

The step is needed because we are not flushing data blocks at commit and it could be that the changes of a committed transaction are not yet in persistent storage, hence the need to redo those changes upon recovery

### 2.7 NO-UNDO/NO-REDO
#### Data Structure
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkpSoY7Oo.pn =600x)

#### Transaction Operations
- **READ:**
    - If the value has not been written before by the transaction, using the current directory to find the latest committed copy
    - If the value has been written before by the transaction, use the shadow directory of that transaction to find the updated copy
- **WRITE:** Write to a buffer and add a pointer in the shadow directory for the transactions
- **COMMIT:** 
    - Create a full directory by merging the current one and the shadow directory of the transaction
    - Swap the pointer indicating the latest committed directory
- **ABORT:** Discard the buffer and the shadow directory

#### Notes
- Not used in practice although some of the ideas can be partially applied
- Access to storage requires an indirection through the directory that indicates which one is the latest version. This is too expensive
- It requires garbage collection of all the uncommitted values, shadow directories, etc.
- It moves data all the time, creating problems with the block representation in, e.g., clustered indexes or hash clustered tables

## 3. Implementation
### 3.1 Log Blocks vs Data Blocks
- Data blocks: prefer larger blocks
- Log records: prefer smaller blocks
- Many systems use a log block size of 512 bytes: the size of a physical sector on disks

### 3.2 Managing the Log (Oracle Example)
#### In-memory Log: Redo Log
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJp_atQ_o.png =400x)

Circular Buffer in Memory
- Also contains undo data
- As transactions modify data, redo records are created in memory and placed in the redo log buffer
- When a commit occurs, the redo records are flushed to a file in storage
- A size often mentioned in system manuals is 60KB

#### In-storage Log: LGWR
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyNO0tQ_i.png =300x)

- The log writer only writes to a single redo log file at a time
- When a file is full and needs to be archived, the LSN is increased and the system switches to a new redo log file
- That way, archival does not interfere with normal operations as the system always has a redo log file where it can write

### 3.3 Group Commit
Instead of flushing the log buffer for every transaction, systems often commit transactions in groups or batches:
- Slight delay in committing but less I/O since all the log entries are written in one go
- Can happen anyway as part of committing transactions when using a circular log buffer

### 3.4 Write Ahead Logging
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry0VWq7Os.png =400x)

Typically used to implement UNDO/REDO (on 2PL based systems) or no-UNDO/REDO (on SI based systems)

- Separate persistent storage for data from persistent storage for the log
- Log records corresponding to a change in the database must be written to the log before changes to the data in the buffer cache are flushed to permanent storage

### 3.5 Checkpoints
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkO7M5XOi.png =400x)

Recovery happens from a checkpoint instead of from the beginning

Note that a checkpoint is not necessarily a consistent copy of the database
- Push all dirty blocks to disk
- Push all the logs in the log buffer to disk
- Active transaction table, dirty page table (system state)
- Mark the log with a checkpoint label and flush it to the log

### 3.6 ARIES Style Recovery
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1tym97di.png =300x)

If we use WAL, recovery with a checkpoint is as follows
- Find the latest completed checkpoint in the log
- Traverse the log to the end analyzing what has been done:
    - Identify transactions that were active at the time of the crash
    - Identify dirty pages that might have not made it to the disk at the time of the crash
- Apply all updates (redo) starting from the log entry matching the lowest SCN in the dirty pages
- Undo all transactions that were active at the time of the crash
