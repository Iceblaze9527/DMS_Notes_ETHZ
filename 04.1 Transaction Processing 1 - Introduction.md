# 04.1 Transaction Processing 1: Introduction
[TOC]

## 1. ACID
- **Atomicity:** the notion that an operation or a group of operations must take place in their entirety or not at all
- **Consistency:** operations should take the database from a correct state to another correct state
- **Isolation:** concurrent execution of operations should yield results that are predictable and correct
- **Durability:** the database needs to remember the state it is in at all moments, even when failures occur

### 1.1 Consistency
- **Database State:** The actual values stored in a database at a given point in time (both in memory as well as in storage)
- **Consistent State:** A database state that is the result of correctly applying operations to the database
- **Sequentiality:** In databases, the underlying model of correct execution of operations is sequential execution: all operations are executed one after each other with no concurrency
- **Transactions:** We assume that transactions are correct. The database has mechanisms to prevent incorrect data modifications.
    - Consistency constraints on tables
    - Constraints on values
    - Referential integrity (foreign key constraints)
    - Triggers applying consistency checks

### 1.2 Atomicity
Only a transaction executed in its entirety brings the database from a consistent state to another consistent state. Intermediate results cannot be assumed to be correct.

#### Undo-redo
If a transaction does not complete, we need to make sure that either:
- **Undo:** The initial state is restored and any effects of the transaction are removed
- **Redo:** The intended final state is reached

#### Atomicity requires isolation
If a transaction can see the intermediate state created by another transaction, its input is not guaranteed to be consistent and, thus the output is not guaranteed to be consistent.

### 1.3 Isolation
Transactions are executed in a database as if they were alone in the database and nothing else would be running at the same time
- Transactions should not see the intermediate state of other transactions
- Queries should not see the intermediate state of transactions

#### Concurrency Control and Locking
Isolation in databases is enforced through concurrency control mechanisms

The canonical concurrency control mechanism in databases is locking
- Use locks to prevent conflicting accesses
- Use locking policies to ensure transactions are isolated

### 1.4 Durability
Durability ensures that the changes of a completed transaction are remembered by the system and can be recovered

:::info
**Note:** write to the **memory** of all machines (but eventually you write to disk, but you need to decide when)
:::

#### Recovery and the Log
The log and the snapshots allow to go back and forward in the history of the database by undoing or redoing transactions from a given snapshot
- The transaction history is captured in the database log
- The consistent database state at a given point in time is captured in snapshots

## 2. Transaction Model
### 2.1 Defining a Transaction
- Begin of transaction (BOT): often implicit
- **Commit:** transaction has finished, database confirms to client when all changes of the transaction have been made persistent
- **Abort/rollback:** transaction is cancelled, database rollbacks all (part of the) changes done by the transaction
- **Read:** read a data item
- **Write:** write a data item

### 2.2 Transactions in Real Systems
- `COMMIT` = indicates the transaction will not do any more changes and all the changes made must be made persistent and durable: The database engine will confirm the commit only after it is sure the changes are persistent and/or have been recorded
- `ROLLBACK` = indicates that the transaction is being cancelled and all of its changes must be removed from the system
- `SAVEPOINTS` = allow to temporarily commit the changes made by a transaction up to the savepoint
- `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` = allows to cancel all the changes made by a transaction after the indicated savepoint, bringing the state seen by the transaction to that of the savepoint

### 2.3 Transaction Operations
- **Read Operations:** represent access to a tuple without modifying it:`r1[x]`
- **Write Operations:** represent access to a tuple that change the value of the tuple: `w1[y]`

### 2.4 Histories
A history H is a partial ordered ($<_H$) sequence of operations from a set of transactions where
- If two operations are ordered within a transaction, they are equally ordered in the history
- If two operations, p and q, conflict then they are ordered with respect to each other: $p<_H q$ or $q<_H p$

## 3. Concurrency Control
Concurrency control has the goal of ensuring correct executions of concurrent transactions.

### 3.1 Serial History
A history H is serial if, for every two transactions $T_i$ and $T_j$ that appear in H, either all operations from $T_j$ appear before all operations of $T_j$ or viceversa.

A serial history with only committed transactions is correct by definition.

#### Conflicts
two operations over the same item with one of them being a write

### 3.2 Equivalent Histories
Two histories are equivalent iff
1. They are over the same transactions and contain the same operations
2. Conflicting operations of non-aborted transactions are ordered in the same way in both histories

History equivalence captures the fact that, in the two histories, committed transactions see the same state (read the same values) and leave the database in the same state.

#### Conflict Equivalent
If a schedule $S$ can be transformed into a schedule $S^{\prime}$ by a series of swaps of nonconflicting instructions, we say that $S$ and $S^{\prime}$ are conflict equivalent.

### 3.3 Serializable History
A history is serializable iff it is equivalent to a serial history.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1tycKXws.png =600x)

#### Conflict Serializability
We say that a schedule S is conflict serializable if it is conflict equivalent to a serial schedule.

#### [Precedence Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/precedence-graph-for-testing-conflict-serializability-in-dbms/)
We now present a simple and efficient method for determining the conflict serializability of a schedule -- Precedence graph. 

This graph consists of a pair $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges. The set of vertices consists of all the transactions participating in the schedule. The set of edges consists of all edges $T_i \rightarrow T_j$ for which one of three conditions holds:
1. $T_i$ executes write $(Q)$ before $T_j$ executes read $(Q)$.
2. $T_i$ executes read $(Q)$ before $T_j$ executes write $(Q)$.
3. $T_i$ executes write $(Q)$ before $T_j$ executes write $(Q)$.

If the precedence graph for $S$ has a cycle, then schedule $S$ is not conflict serializable. 

If the graph contains no cycles, then the schedule $S$ is conflict serializable.

#### View Serializability
- A schedule is said to be view serialisable, if it’s equivalent to a serial schedule (where no interleaving of transactions is possible)
- To create a view serialisable history, we can reorder some operations in the transaction history, to create a serial history and resolve cycles in the precedence graph

## 4. Recovery
Recovery has the aim to make sure that, even in the case of failures, the changes from transactions that have not completed are not visible and those of committed transactions are recorded and visible

### 4.1 R1-R4: Recovery procedures
1. Abort/Rollback of a single transaction (regardless of why)
- **R1:** Undo all changes from the transaction

2. System crash: lose main memory, keep disk
- **R2:** Redo the changes from committed transactions
- **R3:** Undo the changes that remain in the system from active transactions

3. System crash with loss of disks
- **R4:** Read consistent snapshot form backup, if available, apply log

### 4.2 Before Image and After Image
- The changes of an aborted transaction are undone: restoring the before image
- The changes of a committed transaction can be redone: restoring the after image

### 4.3 Recovery on Histories
A transaction $T_1$ reads from another transaction $T_2$ if $T_1$ reads a value written by $T_2$ at a time when $T_2$ was not aborted: `w2[x], r1[x]`

#### Recoverable (RC) History 
:::info
If $T_i$ reads from $T_j$ and commits, then `cj < ci`
:::

- wrong: `w2[x], r1[x], c1, a2` ($T_1$ has read invalid data, Since $T_1$ committed, the data has been returned to the user)
- correct: `w2[x], r1[x], c2, c1`

Recovery now involves correcting the application that has processed the data and might have acted upon it, typically a very expensive procedure.

It is avoided by making sure that $T_1$ does not commit until $T_2$ commits, if $T_2$ aborts, then we can safely abort $T_1$ since the results have not been returned to the user.

#### Avoids Cascading Aborts (ACA) History
:::info
If $T_i$ reads `x` from $T_j$, then `cj < ri[x]`
:::

read something uncommitted would result in cascading aborts
- wrong: `w2[x], r1[x]` -> When $T_2$ aborts, we have to abort $T_1$ because it has read invalid data (the change made by $T_2$ which will be undone as part of the rollback of $T_2$)
- correct: `w2[x], c2, r1[x]`

If cascading of aborts happen very often, performance will suffer since aborting one transaction results in other transactions or queries being aborted.

It is avoided by making sure that uncommitted data is never read.

#### Strict (ST) History
Undoing a transaction does not undo the changes of other transactions

Transactions do not read or overwrite updates of uncommitted transactions

:::info
If $T_i$ reads `x` written by $T_j$, then `cj < ri[x]` or `aj < ri[x]`

If $T_i$ overwrites `x` written by $T_j$, then `cj < wi[x]` or `aj < wi[x]`
:::

- wrong: `w2[x], r1[x]/w1[x], c2/a2`
- correct: `w2[x], c2/a2, r1[x]/w1[x]`

Undoing $T_2$ implies aborting $T_1$: If we undo `w2[x]`, then we also remove the changes made by $T_1$. This is because undoing changes is done by restoring the before image and the before image for `w2` does not include the change made by `w1`.

Like in ACA, non-strict execution leads to cascading aborts of transactions that update the same item which affects performance. 

It is avoided by not letting a value to be read or updated unless it is committed.

## 5. Putting All Together
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyEiM2QDo.png =400x)

### 5.1 Three SQL “Phenomena”
Note that the phenomena considered do not include write-write conflicts

#### Dirty Read `w1[x],r2[x]`
- Occurs when uncommitted data is read
- 🟡 Recoverable
- 🔴 ACA

#### Non-repeatable Read `r2[x],w1[x],r2[x]`
- Occurs when a transaction reads the same item at different times and sees different values each time
- It is the result of somebody else updating the item concurrently
- 🔴 Serializable

#### Phantom Reads
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r19xVhmDj.png =400x)

Occur when a tuple is inserted or deleted on a table: An aggregate over the table will be different before and after the insert/delete

It is not a conflict in the formal sense or necessarily a repeatable read problem

This is a predicate conflict at the table level (a change to the table rather than a tuple)

### 5.2 SQL Isolation Levels
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUeHhQPi.png =600x)

All the isolation levels above additionally disallow dirty writes, that is, they disallow writes to a data item that has already been written by another transaction that has not yet committed or aborted.

#### Read Uncommitted
Used when the operation does not affect reads (or doesn’t matter)
- 🟡 Recoverable
- 🔴 ACA

#### Read Committed
Read committed allows only committed data to be read, but does not require re- peatable reads.
- 🟡 Serializable
- 🟢 Recoverable
- 🟡 ACA

#### Repeatable Read
Repeatable read allows only committed data to be read and further requires that, between two reads of a data item by a transaction, no other transaction is allowed to update it.
- 🟡 Serializable
- 🟢 ACA
- 🟡 Strict

#### Serializable
Does not match the canonical definition of serializability!
- 🟢 Serializable

### 5.3 Dependency Issues
The following histories are neither serializable nor strict but is
serializable according to the SQL criteria:
- `w1[x], w2[x], w2[y], w1[y]`
- `r1[x], w2[x], r2[y], w1[y]`

This cannot happen if using two-phase locking. However, some systems using snapshot isolation do not consider it problematic, and there are situations where it is incorrect: if there's dependency between x and y, because the implementation of snapshot isolation allows parallelism of 1 and 2.
