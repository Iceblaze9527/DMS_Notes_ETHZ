# 02.3 Access Methods 3: Access Methods in Context
[TOC]

## 5. Denormalized Tables
### 5.1 Motivation
- Joins are expensive
- It makes sense to store table together if tables are more often accessed together than on their own
- Reduces I/O, save space

### 5.2 Implementation: Clustered Tables (Oracle)
Some systems allow to cluster tables into the same segment so that blocks contain data form both tables (indexed by the common attributes/keys)

### 5.3 Comments
- It is a form of materialized view with a join already performed
- Updates can become expensive

## 6. Log Structured Databases
### 6.1 Log-structured File
- Instead of storing tuples and modifying them as needed, keep a record of how the data was modified (a log)
- New entries are appended at the end of the file
- Index the tuples and their modifications (entry could contain pointer to previous entry referring to that tuple)

### 6.2 Optimization

- Periodically compact the log: Remove the history and add one entry for every tuple

### 6.3 Comments
- In cloud storage, file storage is typically append only
- It minimizes the cost of making the data persistent (very expensive for OLTP databases with many transactions)
- Not for heavy query analytics but very good for in memory transactional workloads
- Increasingly being used in a number of databases, especially cloud databases

## 7. No Indices
### 7.1 Micro-partitions (Snowflake)
#### Motivation
Indices are expensive, so it depends whether to use them

#### Pruning based on metadata
- The header for a micro-partition contains information about the data.
- For range search, for example, if the header contains the min and max in the data, we can decide we do not need that micro-partition simply by looking at the header

### 7.2 Database Cracking (MonetDB)

- Do not create an index, instead, build the index incrementally while the data is being processed
- Based on creating a copy of the column
- Initial queries expensive, later cost is amortized as work has already been done
