# 03.3 Query Processing 3: Optimization I – Heuristics & Rewriting
[TOC]

## 1. Views and Schemas
### 1.1 A Database with a View
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJJjJWPoo.png =600x)

- A **view**, when created, results in a virtual table being added to the schema
- A **materialized view** results in an actual table being added to the schema with the data described in the view

### 1.2 Why Views?
- To implement logical data independence (create a schema different from the original one)
- To make it easier to write applications by providing views that combine data in useful ways
- To make it easier to write queries by writing intermediate stages as views
- For access control by giving a user access to a view instead of to the base tables
- To speed up processing by materializing the view and having the data already pre-processed for some queries

### 1.3 Schemas
In general, a relation schema consists of a list of attributes and their corresponding domains

#### OLAP: Star Schema
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkOY3_pHs.png =600x)

- **One Fact table (very big):** with the central element of the schema
- **Dimension tables (typically smaller):** with more data on the different attributes that are mentioned in the fact table
- The tables are **not normalized**

#### OLAP: Snowflake Schema
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJoC2dari.png =400x)

- **One Fact table (very big):** with the central element of the schema
- **Dimension tables (typically smaller):** with more data on the different attributes that are mentioned in the fact table
- Some or all tables are **normalized:** Normalization is applied to low cardinality attributes to remove redundancy

#### OLAP: Snowstorm Schema
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJj76d6rs.png =400x)

- **Multiple Fact Tables (very big):** to enable joins between large tables (fact to fact joins)
- **Dimension tables (typically smaller):** with more data on the different attributes that are mentioned in one of the fact tables
- Some or all tables are **normalized:**
- The different fact and dimension tables are connected between them.

### 1.4 Schemas and Views
Schemas provide the basic organization of the data. Views allow to tailor that logical organization to the needs of particular applications without changing the basic schema.

The more complex the schema (very common in serious applications), the more extensive use of views
- Provide an application with the data it needs without having to understand the whole schema
- Since many applications will be running off the same schema (marketing, sales, auditing, logistics, etc.), each one can get just the data it needs simplifying application development
- Common operations over the schema can be captured with materialized views

### 1.5 Query Templates
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By0QCO6Bs.png =600x)

In a commercial setting, it is very rare that a database will be used interactively with a user typing queries directly at a terminal, but rather used programmatically
- An application program contains queries that are run to extract the data the program needs
- A user interface generates queries after the user checks some options
- A service can be provided by providing an RPC-like interface to already written queries that implement the service (users call a procedure, not a query)

## 2. Query Rewriting
transforming the original SQL query into an equivalent SQL query. 

- Query rewriting is typically done just looking at the schema, without paying attention to statistics or cost estimates.
- give the query optimizer more freedom to operate.
- make queries more efficient.
- not necessarily make compilation easier

### 2.0 Rewriting Predicates
- find ways to reduce the number of comparisons that need to be made
- avoid having to go several times over the same tuple, each one checking a different predicate

### 2.1 Predicate Transformation
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJA4gKpSo.png =600x)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk2HRNABj.png =600x)

- `OR`: Preferred if there is an index over deptno (follow the index for the three values). `#index_access = 3`
- `IN`: Preferred if there is no index over deptno (match every tuple against set of values). `#table scan = 1`

### 2.2 Predicate Augmentation (Transitive Closure)
Using transitivity to include more predicates gives the optimizer more
options to consider

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkXVyB0Bj.png =600x)

By adding the second predicate on `emp.workdept`, the optimizer can filter out tuples form the table emp before doing the join, making it cheaper

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyuY1SCHi.png =600x)

By adding `T.id = S.id`, we are telling the optimizer that it can choose any combination of joins of those three tables. (Assume $\mathrm{T} \bowtie S$ produces almost no results)

### 2.3 Predicate Pushdown (View Folding)
Some of the query rewriting involving views might seem trivial but it is necessary:
- User might not have access to base tables (access controls)
- Queries might be automatically generated and the easiest way to do it is to treat the view as a table
- queries involving base tables are optimized more effectively than queries involving views.

#### Case 1
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1kuWrCro.png =600x)

- **Before:** As written, the query computes the view and then filters for the lastname. It goes over the data twice
- **After:** The query works on the base table and does a single pass over the data

#### Case 2
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1rmXBAHi.png =600x)


#### Case 3
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syg8SBCBs.png =400x)![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkAZBrRrs.png =300x)

### 2.4 Unnesting
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk6GwHABi.png =600x)

- **Before:** These are two queries and the check against the nested query is an expensive operation (a scan)
- **After:** There is only one query with a join, a more efficient way to execute the query

#### Why is query nesting used?
- Nested queries might seem more complex but, in reality, make the writing of complex SQL queries easier. 
- Nested queries are also a natural way to work with views (the view is included in the query as a nested query). 
- We rely on the query rewriter and optimizer to make the whole thing more efficient.

### 2.5 Materialized Views
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ32wH0Sj.png =400x)

If views are materialized, it pays off to use a view rather than going to the base table. This can be done even for partial matches between the query and the view

### 2.6 Arithmetic
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJo--BRHi.png =600x)

The new query performs only two calculations for each tuple: `SUM`, `COUNT` and derives the `AVG` from the others

## 3. Basic Optimization Heuristics
We have a formalism to prove equivalence among queries, thereby enabling rewriting and transformations with the guarantee that the result will be the same

- Optimization is NP hard and queries have to be done fast, hence a lot of trade-offs in decision making
- Optimizer does not pursue perfection, but rather make the average cases good enough
- Consistency matters in application! also mind tail latency issues.

### 3.1 Conjunction of Selection
Conjunctive selection operations can be deconstructed into a sequence of individual selections. $$\sigma_{\theta_1 \wedge \theta_2}(E)=\sigma_{\theta_1}\left(\sigma_{\theta_2}(E)\right)$$

#### Use cases
1. utilize materialized view
2. do selection on the most selective / cheapest predicate first, then less selective / more expensive predicates

### 3.2 Commutativity of Selection
$$\sigma_{\theta_2}\left(\sigma_{\theta_1}(E)\right)=\sigma_{\theta_1}\left(\sigma_{\theta_2}(E)\right)
$$

#### Use cases
1. Use indices first
2. do selection on the most selective / cheapest predicate first, then less selective / more expensive predicates
    - In row stores, we check a tuple starting with the most selective predicate
    - In column stores, we start with the column with the most selective predicate

### 3.3 Commutativity of Theta Joins (Natural Joins)
Theta-join operations (and natural joins) are commutative. $$
E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2=E_2 \bowtie_\theta E_1$$ 

### 3.4 Associativity of Theta Joins (Natural Joins)
Natural join operations are associative: $$\left(E_1 \bowtie E_2\right) \bowtie E_3=E_1 \bowtie\left(E_2 \bowtie E_3\right)$$ 

Theta joins are associative in the following manner: $$\left(E_1 \bowtie_{\theta 1} E_2\right) \bowtie_{\theta 2 \wedge \theta 3} E_3=E_1 \bowtie_{\theta 1 \wedge \theta 3}\left(E_2 \bowtie_{\theta 2} E_3\right)$$ where $\theta_2$ involves attributes from only $E_2$ and $E_3$.  Any of these conditions may be empty; hence, it follows that the Cartesian product (×) operation is also associative. 

#### Use cases
The commutativity and associativity of join operations are important for join reordering in query optimization.

### 3.5 Selections with Theta Joins
This expression is just the definition of the theta join. $$\sigma_\theta\left(E_1 \times E_2\right) \equiv E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2$$ Also, $$\sigma_{\theta_1}\left(E_1 \bowtie_{\theta_2} E_2\right) \equiv E_1 \bowtie_{\theta_1 \wedge \theta_2} E_2$$

#### Use cases
1. Reduce the tuples involved in cartesian products
2. Query unnesting:

### 3.6 Selection Distributes over Theta Join
The selection operation distributes over the theta join operation under the following two conditions:
- When all the attributes in $\theta_0$ involve only the attributes of one of the expressions $\left(E_1\right)$ being joined.$$\sigma_{\theta_0}\left(E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2\right)=\left(\sigma_{\theta_0}\left(E_1\right)\right) \bowtie_\theta E_2$$
- When $\theta_1$ involves only the attributes of $E_1$ and $\theta_2$ involves only the attributes of $E_2$. $$\sigma_{\theta_1\wedge\theta_2}\left(E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2\right)=\left(\sigma_{\theta_1}\left(E_1\right)\right) \bowtie_\theta\left(\sigma_{\theta_2}\left(E_2\right)\right)$$

#### Use cases
This rule is what allows predicate pushdown

### 3.7 Projection Distributes over Theta Join
The projections operation distributes over the theta join operation as follows:
- Suppose that the join condition $\theta$ involves only attributes from $L_1 \cup L_2$: $$\Pi_{L_1 \cup L_2}\left(E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2\right)=\left(\Pi_{L_1}\left(E_1\right)\right) \bowtie_\theta\left(\Pi_{L_2}\left(E_2\right)\right)$$
- Consider a join $E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2$.
    - let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be sets of attributes from $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively.
    - let $L_3$ be attributes of $E_1$ that are involved in join condition $\theta$, but are not in $L_1 \cup L_2$
    - let $L_4$ be attributes of $E_2$ that are involved in join condition $\theta$, but are not in $L_1 \cup L_2$ $$\Pi_{L_1 \cup L_2}\left(E_1 \bowtie_\theta E_2\right)=\Pi_{L_1 \cup L_2}\left(\left(\Pi_{L_1 \cup L_3}\left(E_1\right)\right) \bowtie_\theta\left(\Pi_{L_2 \cup L_4}\left(E_2\right)\right)\right)$$

#### Use cases
This rule enables projection push down

### 3.8 Commutativity of Set Union and Intersection
The set operations union and intersection are commutative (set difference is not commutative). $$\begin{aligned}
&E_1 \cup E_2=E_2 \cup E_1 \\
&E_1 \cap E_2=E_2 \cap E_1\end{aligned}$$ Set difference is not commutative.

### 3.9 Associativity of Set Union and Intersection
Set union and intersection are associative. $$\begin{gathered}\left(E_1 \cup E_2\right) \cup E_3=E_1 \cup\left(E_2 \cup E_3\right) \\\left(E_1 \cap E_2\right) \cap E_3=E_1 \cap\left(E_2 \cap E_3\right)\end{gathered}$$ 

### 3.10 Selection Operation Distributes Over Set Operations
The selection operation distributes over $\cup$, $\cap$ and $-$ $$
\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_\theta\left(E_1 \cup E_2\right) \equiv \sigma_\theta\left(E_1\right) \cup \sigma_\theta\left(E_2\right) \\
& \sigma_\theta\left(E_1 \cap E_2\right) \equiv \sigma_\theta\left(E_1\right) \cap \sigma_\theta\left(E_2\right) \\
& \sigma_\theta\left(E_1-E_2\right) \equiv \sigma_\theta\left(E_1\right)-\sigma_\theta\left(E_2\right)
\end{aligned}$$

Also: $$\begin{aligned}
& \sigma_\theta\left(E_1 \cap E_2\right) \equiv \sigma_\theta\left(E_1\right) \cap E_2 \\
& \sigma_\theta\left(E_1-E_2\right) \equiv \sigma_\theta\left(E_1\right)-E_2
\end{aligned}$$

### 3.11 Projection Operation Distributes Over Set Union
$$\Pi_{\mathrm{L}}\left(E_1 \cup E_2\right)=\left(\Pi_{\mathrm{L}}\left(E_1\right)\right) \cup\left(\Pi_{\mathrm{L}}\left(E_2\right)\right)
$$ 
provided $E_1$ and $E_2$ have the same schema.
