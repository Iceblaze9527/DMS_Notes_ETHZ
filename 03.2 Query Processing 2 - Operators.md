# 03.2 Query Processing 2: Operators
[TOC]

## 2.1 Access to base tables
### 2.1.1 Row ID Access

#### 1. when there is a predicate over an indexed attribute: 
- use the index to find the matching tuples and retrieve them using the row_id
- if there are many matches, it might induce many random accesses to different blocks

#### 2. with more complex predicates:
- use the index to find the matching tuples using the indexed attribute
- retrieve the tuples that match the other predicate

### 2.1.2 Full Table Scan
A full table scan reads all the blocks and all the tuples in each block
Full table scan is the upper bound in cost for retrieving data from a base table
Nevertheless, it reads the data sequentially and it can take advantage of prefetching

1. There are no indexes or indexes are not selective enough
2. Predicates involving several columns of the same table (self join): indices cannot help you
3. Low selectivity: The amount of data retrieved is large enough that sequential access is better than many random accesses

Several ways to minimize the overhead of a full table scan:
- Shared scans = use the cursor from the scan of another query
- Sample scans = do not read everything but just a sample
- Column store = scanning a compressed column using SIMD can be fast once data is in memory

### 2.1.3 Clustered Indices
A clustered index enforces that the data in the extent is organized according to the index
- Hash index = tuples with same key are in the same bucket

### 2.1.4 Zone Maps
- A zone map is a combination of coarse index and statistics 
    - For every block of a table, Keep the max and min values for some or all columns
    - Before reading a block, check the zone map: If range does not match the predicate, do not read the block
- It can significantly reduce I/O cost
- In some cases it can replace an index
- Other statistics can be kept in a zone map

### 2.1.5 Other Considerations
- A table scan using an index can be expensive but it will return sorted data: 
    - Expensive if index not clustered but might be cheaper than sorting the data
- I/O is significantly more expensive that accessing data in memory
    - Random accesses are far worse for I/O than for data in memory
    - Scans in memory can be reasonably fast
    - Changes the decision points between random access and scans
- Scans on columns not the same as scans on rows

## 2.2 Sorting and Aggregation
Sorting requires extra space and CPU
- need to copy the whole table into workspace
- not sort on buffer cache: otherâ€™s not gonna use it

### 2.2.1 External sort
Why external sort?
- Obvious: data does not fit in main memory (data and results!!)
- Less obvious: many queries running at the same time sharing memory

N: size of the input in pages
M: size of the buffer in pages

#### Phase I: Create Runs
1. Load allocated buffer space with tuples
2. Sort tuples in buffer pool
3. Write sorted tuples (run) to disk
4. Goto Step 1 (create next run) until all tuples processed

#### Phase II: Merge Runs
- Use priority heap to merge tuples from runs

#### Special cases
- M >= N: no merge needed
- M < sqrt(N): multiple merge phases necessary

#### Base config size of the buffer:
- #blocks - 1 are used to read data blocks in
- 1 block is used to write data out

#### Better config size of the buffer:
- #blocks - 2 are used to read data blocks in
- 2 or more blocks to write data out so that we do not have to wait to write a block out

### 2.2.2 Multi-way Merge (Parallelization)
Previous algorithm is a one-pass algorithm (every data item is read once and written once). However, if there are many runs, I/O overhead is too high (we need to bring too many runs to memory). Also, Merge step cannot be parallelized.

### 2.2.3 Speed up Sorting
Prefetching and double buffering:
- Use more than one block for writing data out
- Prefetch blocks as needed while processing

Take advantage of indexes
- Clustered: read the data in order as it is already sorted (no CPU cost, sequential access)
- Non-clustered: use the index to read the data in order (no CPU cost but very expensive in terms of random access), may work for small ranges

### 2.2.4 Hashing: Distinct and Aggregation

### 2.2.5 External Hashing

For hashing, we use M buffers, 1 to read data in, M-1 to write data out

## 2.3 Joins
### 2.3.1 Nested Loop Join
- Outer table is the table used in the outer loop
- Inner table is the table used in the inner loop
- Outer table always the smaller of the two tables (in number of blocks): Maximizes sequential access in the inner loop, cache locality, pre-fetching, etc.
- Complexity is $O\left(|R|^*|S|\right)$, i.e., $O\left(N^2\right)$

### 2.3.2 Blocked Nested Loop Join
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJoUuXOBs.png =300x)![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1SUvQuSs.png =300x)

- Motivation: blocks of inner table may not fit into cache: there would be page/block misses for every subsequent tuple!

### 2.3.3 Nested Loop Joins on Indexed Table
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk8AYQdSj.png =600x)

- The situation is complicated. The database needs some info to determine which is better, index scan or table scan.

### 2.3.7 Canonical Hash Join
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B19n0ivBo.png =600x)

- No sorting compared to sort-merge join
- Complexity: $O(|R|+|S|)$, i.e., $O(N)$
- Easy to parallelize

### 2.3.8 Grace Hash Join
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1WghQ_Hs.png =600x)

- hash join using blocks: parallelizable
- skews can be problematic!
