# 01.1 Storage Management 1: Memory Hierarchy + Segments and File Storage
[TOC]

## 1. Memory Hierarchy
### 1.1 Main Memory Issues
- **Application Growth:** There is never enough of it
- **Memory Wall:** Memory outside the CPU chip (DRAM) is much slower than memory located in the CPU
- **Processor-memory Gap:** processor speeds increased much faster than memory speeds
- **Price:** DRAM is expensive
- **Non-persistency**

### 1.2 Factors of Memory Hierachy
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJqmgOvzo.png =400x)

#### Why This Matters
- Data movement is one of the major sources of energy consumption and inefficiencies in modern computers (and data centers)
- Performance and efficiency largely determined by how well the database manages the movement of data across the hierarchy

#### Factor 1: Capacity

#### Factor 2: Latency

#### Factor 3: Access Method
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy0BZuPfo.png =600x)

#### Other Factors
- Cost
- Bandwidth

### 1.3 Solutions
#### Locality
- **Spatial locality:** put together what belongs together
- **Temporal locality:** do at the same time things that require the same data

#### Pre-fetching
Make sure the data is available at the layer where it is needed to hide the latency caused by getting data from a lower layer

#### Caching Strategies (Later on this Topic)

#### Replacement Strategies

### 1.4 Current Architectural Problems
Problem is becoming far more involved due to architectural developments

#### [Future Bus: Compute Express Link (CXL)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Compute_Express_Link)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkUVYOwzs.png =800x)

Compute Express Link (CXL) is an open standard for high-speed central processing unit (CPU)-to-device and CPU-to-memory connections, designed for high performance data center computers. CXL is built on the PCI Express (PCIe) physical and electrical interface and includes PCIe-based block input/output protocol (CXL.io) and new cachecoherent protocols for accessing system memory (CXL.cache) and device memory (CXL.mem).

#### Cloud Computing and Economies of Scale
- Physical Seperation of Compute and Storage

#### Network Attached Storage
- Round trip time in a data center is less than a seek operation on a HDD
- [RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Remote%20direct%20memory%20access) reduces latencies by removing OS related inefficiencies
- Eventually it might be faster to get data from the memory of a remote machine or remote storage device than from a local disk.

## 2. [Segments and File Storage - Example: Oracle 19](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/cncpt/logical-storage-structures.html)

### 2.0 Preliminary Knowledge
#### [Virtual Memory](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Virtual_memory)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byk2CZofo.png =200x)

#### [Page](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Page_(computer_memory))
A page, memory page, or virtual page is a fixed-length contiguous block of virtual memory, described by a single entry in the page table. It is the smallest unit of data for memory management in a virtual memory operating system. Similarly, a page frame is the smallest fixed-length contiguous block of physical memory into which memory pages are mapped by the operating system.

### 2.1 Overview
#### Logical and Physical Storage
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyakMzjMi.png =300x)

> This graphic depicts the relationship between logical and physical storage structures in crow's feet notation. In the Logical column on the left are Tablespace, Segment, Extent, and Oracle data block. Each type has a one-to-many relationship with the type below it. In the Physical column on the right are Datafile and OS block. Tablespace has a one-to-many relationship with Datafile. Oracle data block has a one-to-many relationship with OS block. Datafile has a one-to-many relationship with extent.

#### Segments, Extents, and Data Blocks Within a Tablespace
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1pF7Gjzo.png =600x)

> This graphic depicts the relationship between a Tablespace, Segment, Datafiles, Extents, and Data Blocks.

> The tablespace holds one Segment of 96 Kb. The segment is divided into one extent of 24 Kb and another of 72 Kb, each of which is in a separate datafile. The 72 Kb extent maps to 12 rows of 2 Kb blocks, with 32 Kb blocks in each row. The 24 Kb extent maps to 12 2 Kb blocks.


#### Tablespaces - logical locality
A tablespace provides a logical representation of the principle of spatial locality (keep together what belongs together)
- Schema related: Metadata
- Engine related: Data structures for the database engine

Space (memory/disk) is allocated to tablespaces

#### Segments - allocate virtual space to objects
A segment is a set of extents allocated for a specific database (schema) object, such as data and index.

Every database object that consumes storage consists of a single segment.

#### Extents - allocate contiguous space
An extent is a set of **logically contiguous** data blocks allocated for storing a specific type of information. (`malloc()`)

Extents are mapped to one data file (and typically to a file)

#### Blocks - glorified OS pages
A data block is the smallest logical unit of data storage in Oracle Database (not necessarily a page, databases typically use blocks larger than an OS page).

One logical data block corresponds to a specific number of bytes of physical disk space, for example, 2 KB. The size of the blocks is a tunable parameter.

### [2.2 Design Explained](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/logical.htm)
- **Tablespace:** Tablespaces provide a logical unit to refer to the storage of well defined entities (a table, an index, a buffer, etc.)
- **Segments:** Virtual space is allocated to a Tablespace in a segment. A segment acts as a form of virtual memory where everything belonging to the same entity appears continuous and can be treated as a single unit
- **Extents:** Actual space is allocated to a segment through extents. Extents are sets of blocks that are **logically contiguous** on storage and can be allocated as a whole. Because extents are allocated as needed, the extents of a segment **may or may not be physically contiguous** on disk.
- **Blocks:** The space in a segment is divided into blocks which typically correspond to several OS pages.

These structures are created to provide **physical data independence.** Higher layers only need to know in which tablespace a table is. This allows the engine to change everything below by simply changing the pointers to the segment, to the extents, etc.
- If we need more space for a table or an index, the table is still referred to by its segment, but the segment indexes as many extents as needed.
- If we partition a table, each partition has its own segment but the table is still referred to by its tablespace

### [2.3 Extents - Virtual Address Space](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/logical.htm)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkPM5rszi.png =600x)

> The graphic depicts a data file as a vertical rectangle. The topmost slab is labeled "Data File Header." Below is a slab of 12 blocks. The whole slab is labeled "Initial Extent of Segment." The first block is labeled "First Block of Segment (contains directory of extents)." The 3rd block from the left is labeled "Data Block (logically contiguous with other blocks in the extent)." The rest of the data file is blank and is labeled "Free (Formatted, Never Used)." 

#### Dynamic Extents
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B12_cBjGj.png =600x)

> The graphic contains two data files as vertical rectangles. The data file on the left is named users01.dbf. The top slab is all black. Below is a row of 12 blocks labeled Initial Extent. Halfway down the file is another slab labeled Incremental Extent. On the bottom left corner are three white blocks. The data file on the right is named users02.dbf. The top slab is all black. Partway down is a slab of 12 blocks labeled Incremental Extent. Beneath this slab is a white slab. The white slab is "Free (Formatted, Never Used)." The slabs of 12 blocks are labeled "Used."

#### Design Trade-off
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJmRQNhfo.png =600x)

- Databases must optimize along many dimensions.
- A static file mapping is very easy to manage but induces fragmentation and provides no flexibility
- Dynamic block mapping is extremely flexible but data is not contiguous and is expensive to maintain
- Extents are a compromise:
    - An extent provides a static mapping to a set of blocks (like a static file mapping)
    - When more space is needed, extents are dynamically allocated (like with dynamic block mapping)

#### Allocation Strategy
- Uniform allocation: all extents are of the same size (tunable) and when more space is needed, another extent is added
- Automatic: when more space is needed, a new extent is added and its size optimized according to some criterion.
- A good way to allocate new extents is to increase their size exponentially (~1.25): Better to allocate a bit more than to be constantly allocating new extents (if a table grows, it is likely to keep growing). This is to reduce function calls: maintaining the data structure is expensive

### [2.4 Oracle Data Blocks](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14220/logical.htm)
#### Why not OS pages
- A table, an index might span many OS pages
- Allocating space page by page at OS granularity is too much overhead
- If one OS page belongs to a table, it is likely we will also be interested in the other pages allocated to that table (locality)

This is why, although most databases today use the OS I/O system for writing to disk, they manage their own files and memory representation

#### Block Structure: Slotted Pages
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SychArifj.png =400x)

> This image shows the parts of a database block: common and variable header, table directory, row directory, free space, and row data. The parts are described in subsequent sections. Arrows indicate that the amount of free space in the database block is variable.

- **Header:** address and type of segment (index, table, etc.)
- **Table directory:** schema of the table stored in the block
- **Row directory:** pointers to the actual tuples stored in the block id, block num
- **Free space**
- **Row data (tuples)** stored in the block

The directory grows downwards, the space for tuples is used upwards

#### Optimization - Percentage Free (`PCTFREE`)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1bayIsGo.png =400x)

> allow inserts until 80 percent occupancy

The `PCTFREE` parameter sets the minimum percentage of a data block to be reserved as free space for possible updates to rows that already exist in that block. 

This states that 20% of each data block in this table's data segment be kept free and available for possible updates to the existing rows already within each block. New rows can be added to the row data area, and corresponding information can be added to the variable portions of the overhead area, until the row data and overhead total 80% of the total block size.

#### Optimization - Percentage Used (`PCTUSED`)
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ3pJUjMj.png =400x)

> allow inserts when occupancy under 40 percent

The `PCTUSED` parameter sets the minimum percentage of a block that can be used for row data plus overhead before new rows are added to the block. **After a data block is filled to the limit determined by `PCTFREE`, Oracle considers the block unavailable for the insertion of new rows until the percentage of that block falls beneath the parameter `PCTUSED`.** Until this value is achieved, Oracle uses the free space of the data block only for updates to rows already contained in the data block. 

#### Maintaince Cycle
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryELJ8jMj.png =600x)

> This image shows how `PCTFREE` and `PCTUSED` work together to maintain free space in a data block.
> In step 1, rows are inserted up to 80% only, because `PCTFREE` specifies that 20% of the block must remain open for updates of existing rows.
> In step 2, updates to existing rows use the free space reserved in the block. No new rows can be inserted into the block until the amount of used space is 39% or less.
> In step 3, after the amount of used space falls below 40%, new rows can again be inserted into this block.
> In step 4, rows are inserted up to 80% only, because `PCTFREE` specifies that 20% of the block must remain open for updates of existing rows. This cycle continues.

#### Fragmentation within Blocks
Released space may or may not be contiguous with the main area of free space in a data block. Oracle coalesces the free space of a data block only when 
1. an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement attempts to use a block that contains enough free space to contain a new row piece, and
2. the free space is fragmented so the row piece cannot be inserted in a contiguous section of the block. 

Oracle does this compression only in such situations, because otherwise the performance of a database system decreases due to the continuous compression of the free space in data blocks.

### 2.5 Update Strategy: Segment-wise
#### Used and Free List
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByKepL4Qi.png =600x)

A **segment** contains one or more used and free lists: Not done at the **extent** level because extents are not physically contiguous, so the search for space would be more complex. These lists are stored as part of the segment header.

A free list contains pointers to blocks that have usable free space.

Using several free lists helps avoiding contention when performing parallel inserts or updates.

The free list is updated as transactions execute `INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` statements using the rules established with `PCTFREE` and `PCTUSED` free.

#### Strategy 1: Shadow Paging
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJY_pDszs.png =600x)

- **Pros:**
    - **Recovery:** it is enough to make sure that only clean pages (committed) are written to disk and then the disk contains only clean data
    - **Recovery:** undo of an uncommitted transaction is easy, throw the page away
    - **Concurrency Control:** A transaction can use the copies it makes without interfering with queries which are reading the original copies (snapshot isolation)
- **Cons:**
    - Page access and management is complicated (clean vs dirty pages, copy a page, refresh lists on the segment when transaction commits, etc.)
    - Every update ends up moving a page somewhere else, destroying locality

Shadow paging makes sense when the overhead of creating a copy of the page and managing the copies is small enough
- Main memory (e.g., use the Copy on Write feature of the OS)
- Possibly with Flash and NVM

#### Strategy 2: Delta File
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJg8CwiMs.png =300x)

- Using delta files, before modifying a page, one makes a copy of the page
- The copy is stored in a delta file and can be used to undo the changes
- The update is performed directly on the original page
- The copy in the delta file can be discarded when no longer needed

Delta files are used for many different purposes and in many different ways
- Keep the old data in the delta file: Favors commits, simplifies undo, allows looking at older data
- Keep the new data in the delta file: Favors aborts, allows to delay the propagation of updates
